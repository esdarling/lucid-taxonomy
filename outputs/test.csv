sculpture weakly coriarious to glabrous; Malar space:short, less than one-fifth eye height, MS/EH approx. .15; malar sulcus distinct, and an abrupt change in sculpture; Malar region, sculpture:weakly coriarious; Clypeus:quadrate, only slightly wider than high, CW/CH 1.1-1.2; ovoid, with lateral sulci very weak and rounded; without tentorial pits; epistomal sulcus same strength as lateral sulci; straight; extended ventrad to only about one-fifth height of clypeus; lower margin weakly concave; Supraclypeal area:shorter, .4-.5 clypeus height; Female scape:shorter, about .5 EH; glabrous, mesad with 3-4 very weak apical punctures; Male scape:about .5 EH, slender, narrower at base, length > 5x width above radicle; expanded distad, 1.4-1.5 width above radicle; anterior punctate surface not swollen in lateral view; punctures covering about one-half of scape, PL/SL ~ 0.5; single punctures 4-5um in diameter; many coalesced to form irregular punctures, interspaces very narrow, punctures almost touching; anterior surface reflexed, slighted excavated; Pedicel:longer than F1; Anellus:0.3 F1L; Clava 4-segmented, the:segments annular, C1-3 as long dorsad as ventrad, with distinct terminal button (C4); Mesosoma in dorsal view:short, length about 1.1-1.2 maximum width; in lateral view flattened; Pronotum in dorsal view:short, about one-quarter length of mesoscutum, PN/MSC .23-.26; shorter along midline, .7-.8 length laterad; anterior margin sharp, with a distinct edge; Lateral panel of pronotum:with 2 rows of punctures, the first slightly lower, with flared margin; smoothly curving ventrad; about as wide as prepectus, LPN/PPT 0.7-1.0; Prepectus (new):imbricate to glabrous, with many small weak fovea along dorsal and posterior margins; Femoral depression:rugose; Midlobe of mesoscutum (sculpture):with rounded, shallow punctures and narrow interspaces coalesced to form weak rugae along pronotum; Lateral lobe of mesoscutum (sculpture):glabrous; angulate to rounded punctures, interspaces narrow, glabrous; without posterior carina separating sculpture types; apex of scapula reflexed, acuminate; Scutellum (length):equal in length to mesoscutum, SC/MSC approx. 1; with large, deep rounded punctures and wide coriarious interspaces; Axilla (sculpture):glabrous dorsad, with oblique costae above transverse ridge, imbricate below with crenulate ventral margin; with a distinct posterior carina; Axillula:elongate fingerlike lobe, longer than width at base, glabrous; Metanotum:straplike, length along midline about one-half length of propodeum; dorsellum with two transverse rows of foveae separated by narrow coriarious ridge; Propodeum:transverse, width about 3.5 length of midline; delimited laterad and ventrad by plicae and foveae, dorsad by transverse band of foveae and with long median carina; glabrous to weakly imbricate, with single weak fovea along median carina; expanded dorsad, contiguous with narrow or wide median carina, with transverse rugae; Forewing with:postmarginal vein about one-half lengh of marginal vein (0.4-0.5); parastigma smoothly joining marginal and submarginal veins and usually with 3 linear sensilla forming broad triangle; Petiole, with exposed dorsal suface:rounded, with a high raised and excavated scale, with strong rugae below, apex deeply cleft and rugose; Gs1:with indistinct antecostal sulcus, broad, curved weakly sculptured, with narrow anterior arms articulated with petiole; acrosternite rounded, apex indistinct, weakly emarginate; Gt2:glabrous, concave, strigose along midline; with median groove and weak lateral protuberances;"
